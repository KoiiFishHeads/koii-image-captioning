**Project Overview**

This repository houses the codebase for our KOII image captioning project. We're leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. Our goal is to build a robust model that accurately and eloquently captures the essence of visual content.

**Key Features**

* **State-of-the-art Model:** We're employing advanced neural networks (e.g., Transformer-based architectures) to achieve high-quality captioning.
* **Transfer Learning:** Leveraging pre-trained models on large image datasets to accelerate training and boost performance.
* **Customization:** The codebase is designed for flexibility, allowing you to fine-tune the model on your specific image domain.
* **Evaluation:** We've integrated metrics for evaluating the quality of generated captions.

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/koii-image-captioning.git`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Prepare your dataset:** Organize your images and corresponding captions in the appropriate format (refer to the `data` directory for examples).
4. **Train the model:** `python train.py`
5. **Generate captions:** `python caption.py --image_path /path/to/your/image.jpg`
